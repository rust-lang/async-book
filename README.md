Asynchronous Programming in Rust

## Requirements
The async book is built with [`mdbook`], you can install it using cargo.

```

cargo install mdbook-linkcheck
```

[`mdbook`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook

## Building
To create a finished book, run `mdbook build` to generate it under the `book/` directory.

```

## Development
While writing it can be handy to see your changes, `mdbook serve` will launch a local web
server to serve the book.
```
