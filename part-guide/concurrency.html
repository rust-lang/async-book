<p>The goal of this chapter is to give you a high-level idea of how async concurrency works and how it is different from concurrency with threads. I think it is important to have a good mental model of what is going on before getting in to the practicalities, but if you're the kind of person who likes to see some real code first, you might like to read the next chapter or two and then come back to this one.</p>
<p>We'll start with some motivation, then cover <a href="#sequential-execution">sequential programming</a>, <a href="#processes-and-threads">programming with threads or processes</a>, and then <a href="#async-programming">async programming</a>. The chapter finishes with a section on <a href="#concurrency-and-parallelism">concurrency and parallelism</a>.</p>
<p>Users want their computers to do multiple things. Sometimes users want to do those things at the same time (e.g., be listening to a music app at the same time as typing in their editor). Sometimes doing multiple tasks at the same time is more efficient (e.g., getting some work done in the editor while a large file downloads). Sometimes there are multiple users wanting to use a single computer at the same time (e.g., multiple clients connected to a server).</p>
<p>To give a lower-level example, a music program might need to keep playing music while the user interacts with the user interface (UI). To 'keep playing music', it might need to stream music data from the server, process that data from one format to another, and send the processed data to the computer's audio system via the operating system (OS). For the user, it might need to send and receive data or commands to the server in response to the user instructions, it might need to send signals to the subsystem playing music (e.g., if the user changes track or pauses), it might need to update the graphical display (e.g., highlighting a button or changing the track name), and it must keep the mouse cursor or text inputs responsive while doing all of the above.</p>
<p>Doing multiple things at once (or appearing to do so) is called concurrency. Programs (in conjunction with the OS) must manage their concurrency and there are many ways to do that. We'll describe some of those ways in this chapter, but we'll start with purely sequential code, i.e., no concurrency at all.</p>
<h2 id="sequential-execution"><a class="header" href="#sequential-execution">Sequential execution</a></h2>
<p>The default mode of execution in most programming languages (including Rust) is sequential execution.</p>
<pre><code>do_a_thing();
println!("hello!");
do_another_thing();
</code></pre>
<p>Each statement is completed before the next one starts<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-obs1-1"><a href="#footnote-obs1">1</a></sup>. Nothing happens in between those statements<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-obs2-1"><a href="#footnote-obs2">2</a></sup>. This might sound trivial but it is a really useful property for reasoning about our code. However, it also means we waste a lot of time. In the above example, while we're waiting for <code>println!("hello!")</code> to happen, we could have executed <code>do_another_thing()</code>. Perhaps we could even have executed all three statements at the same time.</p>
<p>Whenever IO<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-io-def-1"><a href="#footnote-io-def">3</a></sup> happens (printing using <code>println!</code> is IO - it is outputting text to the console via a call to the OS), the program will wait for the IO to complete<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-io-complete-1"><a href="#footnote-io-complete">4</a></sup> before executing the next statement. Waiting for IO to complete before continuing with execution <em>blocks</em> the program from making other progress. Blocking IO is the easiest kind of IO to use, implement, and reason about, but it is also the least efficient - in a sequential world, the program can do nothing while it waits for the IO to complete.</p>
<h2 id="processes-and-threads"><a class="header" href="#processes-and-threads">Processes and threads</a></h2>
<p>Processes and threads are concepts which are provided by the operating system to provide concurrency. There is one process per executable, so supporting multiple processes means a computer can run multiple programs<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-proc-program-1"><a href="#footnote-proc-program">5</a></sup> concurrently; there can be multiple threads per process, which means there can also be concurrency <em>within</em> a process.</p>
<p>There are many small differences in the way that processes and threads are handled. The most important difference is that memory is shared between threads but not between processes<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-shmem-1"><a href="#footnote-shmem">6</a></sup>. That means that communication between processes happens by some kind of message passing, similar to communicating between programs running on different computers. From a program's perspective, the single process is their whole world; creating new processes means running new programs. Creating new threads, however, is just part of the program's regular execution.</p>
<p>Because of these distinctions between processes and threads, they feel very different to a programmer. But from the OS's perspective they are very similar and we'll discuss their properties as if they were a single concept. We'll talk about threads, but unless we note otherwise, you should understand that to mean 'threads or processes'.</p>
<p>The OS is responsible for <em>scheduling</em> threads, which means it decides when threads run and for how long. Most modern computers have multiple cores, so they can run multiple threads at literally the same time. However, it is common to have many more threads than cores, so the OS will run each thread for a small amount of time and then pause it and run a different thread for some time<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-sched-1"><a href="#footnote-sched">7</a></sup>. When multiple threads are run on a single core in this fashion, it is called <em>interleaving</em> or <em>time-slicing</em>. Since the OS chooses when to pause a thread's execution, it is called <em>pre-emptive multitasking</em> (multitasking here just means running multiple threads at the same time); the OS <em>pre-empts</em> execution of a thread (or more verbosely, the OS pre-emptively pauses execution. It is pre-emptive because the OS is pausing the thread to make time for another thread, before the first thread would otherwise pause, to ensure that the second thread can execute before it becomes a problem that it can't).</p>
<p>Let's look at IO again. What happens when a thread blocks waiting for IO? In a system with threads, then the OS will pause the thread (it's just going to be waiting in any case) and wake it up again when the IO is complete<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-busywait-1"><a href="#footnote-busywait">8</a></sup>. Depending on the scheduling algorithm, it might take some time after the IO completes until the OS wakes up the thread waiting for IO, since the OS might wait for other threads to get some work done. So now things are much more efficient: while one thread waits for IO, another thread (or more likely, many threads due to multitasking) can make progress. But, from the perspective of the thread doing IO, things are still sequential - it waits for the IO to finish before starting the next operation.</p>
<p>A thread can also choose to pause itself by calling a <code>sleep</code> function, usually with a timeout. In this case the OS pauses the thread at the threads own request. Similar to pausing due to pre-emption or IO, the OS will wake the thread up again later (after the timeout) to continue execution.</p>
<p>When an OS pauses one thread and starts another (for any reason), it is called <em>context switching</em>. The context being switched includes the registers, operating system records, and the contents of many caches. That's a non-trivial amount of work. Together with the transfer of control to the OS and back to a thread, and the costs of working with stale caches, context switching is an expensive operation.</p>
<p>Finally, note that some hardware or OSs do not support processes or threads, this is more likely in the embedded world.</p>
<h2 id="async-programming"><a class="header" href="#async-programming">Async programming</a></h2>
<p>Async programming is a kind of concurrency with the same high-level goals as concurrency with threads (do many things at the same time), but a different implementation. The two big differences between async concurrency and concurrency with threads, is that async concurrency is managed entirely within the program with no help from the OS<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-threads-1"><a href="#footnote-threads">9</a></sup>, and that multitasking is cooperative rather than pre-emptive<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-other-1"><a href="#footnote-other">10</a></sup> (we'll explain that in a minute). There are many different models of async concurrency, we'll compare them later on in the guide, but for now we'll focus only on Rust's model.</p>
<p>To distinguish them from threads, we'll call a sequence of executions in async concurrency a task (they're also called <em>green threads</em>, but this sometimes has connotations of pre-emptive scheduling and implementation details like one stack per task). The way a task is executed, scheduled, and represented in memory is very different to a thread, but for a high-level intuition, it can be useful to think of tasks as just like threads, but managed entirely within the program, rather than by the OS.</p>
<p>In an async system, there is still a scheduler which decides which task to run next (it's part of the program, not part of the OS). However, the scheduler cannot pre-empt a task. Instead a task must voluntarily give up control and allow another task to be scheduled. Because tasks must cooperate (by giving up control), this is called cooperative multitasking.</p>
<p>Using cooperative rather than pre-emptive multitasking has many implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>between points where control might be yielded, you can guarantee that code will be executed sequentially - you'll never be unexpectedly paused,</li>
<li>if a task takes a long time between yield points (e.g., by doing blocking IO or performing long-running computation), other tasks will not be able to make progress,</li>
<li>implementing a scheduler is much simpler and scheduling (and context switching) has fewer overheads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Async concurrency is much more efficient than concurrency with threads. The memory overheads are much lower and context switching is a much cheaper operation - it doesn't require handing control to the OS and back to the program and there is much less data to switch. However, there can still be some cache effects - although the OS's caches such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">TLB</a> don't need to be changed, tasks are likely to operate on different parts of memory, so data required by the newly scheduled task may not be in a memory cache.</p>
<p>Asynchronous <em>IO</em> is an alternative to blocking IO (it's sometimes called non-blocking IO). Async IO is not directly tied to async concurrency, but the two are often used together. In async IO, a program initiates IO with one system call and then can either check or be notified when the IO completes. That means the program is free to get other work done while the IO takes place. In Rust, the mechanics of async IO are handled by the async runtime (the scheduler is also part of the runtime, we'll discuss runtimes in more detail later in this book, but essentially the runtime is just a library which takes care of some of the fundamental async stuff).</p>
<p>From the perspective of the whole system, blocking IO in a concurrent system with threads and non-blocking IO in an async concurrent system are similar. In both cases, IO takes time and other work gets done while the IO is happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>With threads, the thread doing IO requests IO from the OS, the thread is paused by the OS, other threads get work done, and when the IO is done, the OS wakes up the thread so it can continue execution with the result of the IO.</li>
<li>With async, the task doing IO requests IO from the runtime, the runtime requests IO from the OS but the OS returns control to the runtime. The runtime pauses the IO task and schedules other tasks to get work done. When the IO is done, the runtime wakes up the IO task so it can continue execution with the result of the IO.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of using async IO, is that the overheads are much lower so a system can support orders of magnitude more tasks than threads. That makes async concurrency particularly well-suited for tasks with lots of users which spend a lot of time waiting for IO (if they don't spend a lot of time waiting and instead do lots of CPU-bound work, then there is not so much advantage to the low-overheads because the bottleneck will be CPU and memory resources).</p>
<p>Threads and async are not mutually exclusive: many programs use both. Some programs have parts which are better implemented using threads and parts which are better implemented using async. For example, a database server may use async techniques to manage network communication with clients, but use OS threads for computation on data. Alternatively, a program may be written only using async concurrency, but the runtime will execute tasks on multiple threads. This is necessary for a program to make use of multiple CPU cores. We'll cover the intersection of threads and async tasks in a number of places later in the book.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-and-parallelism"><a class="header" href="#concurrency-and-parallelism">Concurrency and Parallelism</a></h2>
<p>So far we've been talking about concurrency (doing, or appearing to do, many things at the same time), and we've hinted at parallelism (the presence of multiple CPU cores which facilitates literally doing many things at the same time). These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are distinct concepts. In this section, we'll try to precisely define these terms and the difference between them. I'll use simple pseudo-code to illustrate things.</p>
<p>Imagine a single task broken into a bunch of sub-tasks:</p>
<pre><code>task1 {
  subTask1-1()
  subTask1-2()
  ...
  subTask1-100()
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's pretend to be a processor which executes such pseudocode. The obvious way to do so is to first do <code>subTask1-1</code> then do <code>subTask1-2</code> and so on until we've completed all sub-tasks. This is sequential execution.</p>
<p>Now consider multiple tasks. How might we execute them? We might start one task, do all the sub-tasks until the whole task is complete, then start on the next. The two tasks are being executed sequentially (and the sub-tasks within each task are also being executed sequentially). Looking at just the sub-tasks, you'd execute them like this:</p>
<pre><code>subTask1-1()
subTask1-2()
...
subTask1-100()
subTask2-1()
subTask2-2()
...
subTask2-100()

</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could do <code>subTask1</code>, then put <code>task1</code> aside (remembering how far you got) and pick up the next task and do the first sub-task from that one, then go back to <code>task1</code> to do a sub-task. The two tasks would be interleaved, we call this concurrent execution of the two tasks. It might look like:</p>
<pre><code>subTask1-1()
subTask2-1()
subTask1-2()
subTask2-2()
...
subTask1-100()
subTask2-100()

</code></pre>
<p>Unless one task can observe the results or side-effects of a different task, then from the task's perspective, the sub-tasks are still being executed sequentially.</p>
<p>There's no reason we have to limit ourselves to two tasks, we could interleave any number and do so in any order.</p>
<p>Note that no matter how much concurrency we add, the whole job takes the same amount of time to complete (in fact it might take longer with more concurrency due to the overheads of context switching between them). However, for a given sub-task, we might get it finished earlier than in the purely sequential execution (for a user, this might feel more responsive).</p>
<p>Now, imagine it's not just you processing the tasks, you've got some processor friends to help you out. You can work on tasks at the same time and get the work done faster! This is <em>parallel</em> execution (which is also concurrent). You might execute the sub-tasks like:</p>
<pre><code>Processor 1           Processor 2
==============        ==============
subTask1-1()          subTask2-1()
subTask1-2()          subTask2-2()
...                   ...
subTask1-100()        subTask2-100()
</code></pre>
<p>If there are more than two processors, we can process even more tasks in parallel. We could also do some interleaving of tasks on each processor or sharing of tasks between processors.</p>
<p>In real code, things are a bit more complicated. Some sub-tasks (e.g., IO) don't require a processor to actively participate, they just need starting and some time later collecting the results. And some sub-tasks might require the results (or side-effects) of a sub-task from a different task in order to make progress (synchronization). Both these scenarios limit the effective ways that tasks can be concurrently executed and that, together with ensuring some concept of fairness, is why scheduling is important.</p>

<p>Concurrency is about ordering of computations and parallelism is about the mode of execution.</p>
<p>Given two computations, we say they are sequential (i.e., not concurrent) if we can observe that one happens before the other, or that they are concurrent if we cannot observe (or alternatively, it does not matter) that one happens before the other.</p>
<p>Two computations happen in parallel if they are literally happening at the same time. We can think of parallelism as a resource: the more parallelism is available, the more computations can happen in a fixed period of time (assuming that computation happens at the same speed). Increasing the concurrency of a system without increasing parallelism can never make it faster (although it can make the system more responsive and it may make it feasible to implement optimizations which would otherwise be impractical).</p>
<p>To restate, two computations may happen one after the other (neither concurrent nor parallel), their execution may be interleaved on a single CPU core (concurrent, but not parallel), or they may be executed at the same time on two cores (concurrent and parallel)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-p-not-c-1"><a href="#footnote-p-not-c">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Another useful framing<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-turon-1"><a href="#footnote-turon">12</a></sup> is that concurrency is a way of organizing code and parallelism is a resource. This is a powerful statement! That concurrency is about organising code rather than executing code is important because from the perspective of the processor, concurrency without parallelism simply doesn't exist. It's particularly relevant for async concurrency because that is implemented entirely in user-side code - not only is it 'just' about organizing code, but you can easily prove that to yourself by just reading the source code. That parallelism is a resource is also useful because it reminds us that for parallelism and performance, only the number of processor cores is important, not how the code is organized with respect to concurrency (e.g., how many threads there are).</p>
<p>Both threaded and async systems can offer both concurrency and parallelism. In both cases, concurrency is controlled by code (spawning threads or tasks) and parallelism is controlled by the scheduler, which is part of the OS for threads (configured by the OS's API), and part of the runtime library for async (configured by choice of runtime, how the runtime is implemented, and options that the runtime provides to client code). There is however, a practical difference due to convention and common defaults. In threaded systems, each concurrent thread is executed in parallel using as much parallelism as possible. In async systems, there is no strong default: a system may run all tasks in a single thread, it may assign multiple tasks to a single thread and lock that thread to a core (so groups of tasks execute in parallel, but within a group each task executes concurrently, but never in parallel with other tasks within the group), or tasks may be run in parallel with or without limits. For the first part of this guide, we will use the Tokio runtime which primarily supports the last model. I.e., the behavior regarding parallelism is similar to concurrency with threads. Furthermore, we'll see features in async Rust which explicitly support concurrency but not parallelism, independent of the runtime.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are many models of execution. We described sequential execution, threads and processes, and asynchronous programming.
<ul>
<li>Threads are an abstraction provided (and scheduled) by the OS. They usually involve pre-emptive multitasking, are parallel by default, and have fairly high overheads of management and context switching.</li>
<li>Asynchronous programming is managed by a user-space runtime. Multi-tasking is cooperative. It has lower overheads than threads, but feels a bit different to programming with threads since it uses different programming primitives (<code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, and futures, rather than first-class threads).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concurrency and parallelism are different but closely related concepts.
<ul>
<li>Concurrency is about ordering of computation (operations are concurrent if their order of execution cannot be observed).</li>
<li>Parallelism is about computing on multiple processors (operations are parallel if they are literally happening at the same time).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both OS threads and async programming provide concurrency and parallelism; async programming can also offer constructs for flexible or fine-grained concurrency which are not part of most operating systems' threads API.</li>

<p>This isn't really true: modern compilers and CPUs will reorganize your code and run it any order they like. Sequential statements are likely to overlap in many different ways. However, this should never be <em>observable</em> to the program itself or its users. <a href="#fr-obs1-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-obs2">
<p>This isn't true either: even when one program is purely sequential, other programs might be running at the same time; more on this in the next section. <a href="#fr-obs2-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-io-def">
<p>IO is an acronym of input/output. It means any communication from the program to the world outside the program. That might be reading or writing to disk or the network, writing to the terminal, getting user input from a keyboard or mouse, or communicating with the OS or another program running in the system. IO is interesting in the context of concurrency because it takes several orders of magnitude longer to happen than nearly any task a program might do internally. That typically means lots of waiting, and that waiting time is an opportunity to do other work. <a href="#fr-io-def-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-io-complete">
<p>Exactly when IO is complete is actually rather complicated. From the program's perspective a single IO call is complete when control is returned from the OS. This usually indicates that data has been sent to some hardware or other program, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the data has actually been written to disk or displayed to the user, etc. That might require more work in the hardware or periodic flushing of caches, or for another program to read the data. Mostly we don't need to worry about this, but it's good to be aware of. <a href="#fr-io-complete-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-proc-program">
<p>from the user's perspective, a single program may include multiple processes, but from the OS's perspective each process is a separate program. <a href="#fr-proc-program-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-shmem">
<p>Some OSs do support sharing memory between processes, but using it requires special treatment and most memory is not shared. <a href="#fr-shmem-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-sched">
<p>Exactly how the OS chooses which thread to run and for how long (and on which core), is a key part of scheduling. There are many options, both high-level strategies and options to configure those strategies. Making good choices here is crucial for good performance, but it is complicated and we won't dig into it here. <a href="#fr-sched-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-busywait">
<p>There's another option which is that the thread can <em>busy wait</em> by just spinning in a loop until the IO is finished. This is not very efficient since other threads won't get to run and is uncommon in most modern systems. You may come across it in the implementations of locks or in very simple embedded systems. <a href="#fr-busywait-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-threads">
<p>We'll start our explanation assuming a program only has a single thread, but expand on that later. There will probably be other processes running on the system, but they don't really affect how async concurrency works. <a href="#fr-threads-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-other">
<p>There are some programming languages (or even libraries) which have concurrency which is managed within the program (without the OS), but with a pre-emptive scheduler rather than relying on cooperation between threads. Go is a well-known example. These systems don't require <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> notation, but have other downsides including making interop with other languages or the OS much more difficult, and having a heavyweight runtime. Very early versions of Rust had such a system, but no traces of it remained by 1.0. <a href="#fr-other-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-p-not-c">
<p>Can computation be parallel but not concurrent? Sort of but not really. Imagine two tasks (a and b) which consist of one sub-task each (1 and 2 belonging to a and b, respectively). By the use of synchronisation, we can't start sub-task 2 until sub-task 1 is complete and task a has to wait for sub-task 2 to complete until it is complete. Now a and b run on different processors. If we look at the tasks as black boxes, we can say they are running in parallel, but in a sense they are not concurrent because their ordering is fully determined. However, if we look at the sub-tasks we can see that they are neither parallel or concurrent. <a href="#fr-p-not-c-1">↩</a></p>
