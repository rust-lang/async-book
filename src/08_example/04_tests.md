# Testing the TCP Server
Let's move on to testing our `handle_connection` function.

First, we need a `TcpStream` to work with.
In an end-to-end or integration test, we might want to make a real TCP connection
to test our code.
One strategy for doing this is to start a listener on `localhost` port 0.
Port 0 isn't a valid UNIX port, but it'll work for testing.
The operating system will pick an open TCP port for us.

Instead, in this example we'll write a unit test for the connection handler,
to check that the correct responses are returned for the respective inputs.
To keep our unit test isolated and deterministic, we'll replace the `TcpStream` with a mock.

First, we'll change the signature of `handle_connection` to make it easier to test.
`handle_connection` doesn't actually require an `async_std::net::TcpStream`;
it requires any struct that implements `async_std::io::Read`, `async_std::io::Write`, and `marker::Unpin`.
Changing the type signature to reflect this allows us to pass a mock for testing.
```rust,ignore
use std::marker::Unpin;
use async_std::io::{Read, Write};

async fn handle_connection(mut stream: impl Read + Write + Unpin) {
```

Next, let's build a mock `TcpStream` that implements these traits.
First, let's implement the `Read` trait, with one method, `poll_read`.
Our mock `TcpStream` will contain some data that is copied into the read buffer,
and we'll return `Poll::Ready` to signify that the read is complete.
```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../examples/08_05_final_tcp_server/src/main.rs:mock_read}}
```

Our implementation of `Write` is very similar,
although we'll need to write three methods: `poll_write`, `poll_flush`, and `poll_close`.
`poll_write` will copy any input data into the mock `TcpStream`, and return `Poll::Ready` when complete.
No work needs to be done to flush or close the mock `TcpStream`, so `poll_flush` and `poll_close`
can just return `Poll::Ready`.
```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../examples/08_05_final_tcp_server/src/main.rs:mock_write}}
```

Lastly, our mock will need to implement `Unpin`, signifying that its location in memory can safely be moved.
For more information on pinning and the `Unpin` trait, see the [section on pinning](../04_pinning/01_chapter.md).
```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../examples/08_05_final_tcp_server/src/main.rs:unpin}}
```

Now we're ready to test the `handle_connection` function.
After setting up the `MockTcpStream` containing some initial data,
we can run `handle_connection` using the attribute `#[async_std::test]`, similarly to how we used `#[async_std::main]`.
To ensure that `handle_connection` works as intended, we'll check that the correct data
was written to the `MockTcpStream` based on its initial contents.
```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../examples/08_05_final_tcp_server/src/main.rs:test}}
```
